\title{Implementing Secure Authentication: A Comparison of OAuth 2.0 and Basic Authentication}

%Abstract: 10-15 lines with the software technology and the highlights from the project that has been undertaken.
This project explores the design and implementation of FeedApp, an interactive web application for creating and participating in surveys and polls. The application is built with a modern technology stack, integrating OAuth 2.0 for secure user authentication and token-based authorization, providing a seamless and secure experience for end-users. The backend utilizes Spring Boot and Spring Web MVC to deliver a robust RESTful API, while the frontend, developed with Svelte + Vite, ensures a fast and responsive Single Page Application (SPA).

FeedApp is structured around a well-defined domain model that captures relationships between key entities such as users, surveys, polls, and votes. PostgreSQL and MongoDB are employed for data persistence, meeting the application's structured and unstructured data requirements, while RabbitMQ facilitates efficient message-driven communication. The use of Docker for containerization ensures scalability and smooth deployment.

As part of the project, a technology assessment was conducted to compare OAuth 2.0 against Basic Authentication and API Keys. This evaluation included experiments to measure scalability, implementation complexity, and security. The results highlight OAuth 2.0's superior performance in handling high user loads, its advanced security features such as token expiration and scope limitations, and its flexibility for integrating with third-party systems. These findings affirm the suitability of OAuth 2.0 for scalable and secure web applications.

This project demonstrates how a modular, scalable architecture can support collaborative participation in surveys and polls, while ensuring robust security, high performance, and an intuitive user experience.
