\section{Prototype Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}

This section should provide brief details of how the prototype has been implemented.
You may want to use come code snippets here, but only focus on core features and aspects.
You are not meant to copy/paste your whole application code into the report.
Focus for instance how other developers may run your application and how they might develop it further...


SurveyController.java can be seen as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:surveycontroller}.
