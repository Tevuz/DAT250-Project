% A brief introduction to the prototype implementation and topic of the project.
The FeedApp project seeks to develop a running prototype of a full-stack FeedApp. The purpose of this application is to allow users to create and manage polls and surveys. Registered users can also vote on polls using a web-based user interface. 
\medskip

% Discuss (briefly) the technology stack that has been selected
\noindent
The technology stack is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Java with SpringBoot as the general platform/framework,
\item Spring Web MVC for implementing a HTTP/REST AP,
\item Svelte + Vite for implementing a Single Page App user interface,
\item Jakarta Persistence API with Hibernate and Postgres for implementing object-relational database mapping,
\item MongoDB as a non-relational database,
\item RabbitMQ as a message broker,
\item Docker as a container engine.
\item OAuth 2.0: The chosen authentication protocol ensures secure user authentication and authorization, providing a scalable and standard mechanism to handle access control. We will be conducting a technology assessment according to Brown and Walnau.\cite{brown:96}
\end{itemize}

% A one paragraph overview at the end, explaining how the rest of the report is / has been organised.
\noindent
This rest of this report is organised as follows:

Section~\ref{sec:design} gives a detailed descprition about the functional aspects of the FeedApp application. This includes use cases, domain model and an application flow diagram.

Section~\ref{sec:technology} documents the experiments conducted, following the methodology described in the paper by Brown and Walnau.

Section~\ref{sec:implementation} gives a brief explanation of how the prototype has been implemented. It provides details to those who may want to run the application and how they may develop it further.
