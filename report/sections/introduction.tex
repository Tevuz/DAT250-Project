% A brief introduction to the prototype implementation and topic of the project.
The FeedApp project focuses on creating a functional prototype of a web application where users can create, manage, and participate in surveys and polls. The main goal of the project is to provide users with an easy-to-use interface for voting on polls and managing surveys. At the same time, the project explores and evaluates different authentication methods to determine the best fit for this kind of application.

FeedApp is built using a modern technology stack. For the backend, we used Java with Spring Boot, a popular framework that simplifies building web applications. Spring Web MVC is used to create a REST API, which allows the frontend and backend to communicate. On the frontend, Svelte and Vite were chosen to build a fast and interactive Single Page Application (SPA), providing a smooth experience for users.

For data management, we used PostgreSQL with Hibernate and Jakarta Persistence API (JPA) to handle structured data like users and polls, while MongoDB was included for storing unstructured data. RabbitMQ was used to handle communication between different parts of the application, making it more reliable and scalable. Docker was used for packaging and deployment, simplifying the process of running the application across different environments. To secure the application, we implemented OAuth 2.0, a modern authentication framework that handles user authentication and permissions. The project also compares OAuth 2.0 with other authentication methods to evaluate their performance, scalability, and ease of use.

The project successfully implemented the main features of FeedApp while also providing insights into how different authentication technologies perform under various conditions. These experiments gave a better understanding of how to design secure and scalable web applications.

The rest of this report is structured as follows:

Section~\ref{sec:design} explains the functional aspects of FeedApp, including its use cases, the domain model, and the application’s flow.

Section~\ref{sec:technology} discusses the experiments conducted to compare different authentication technologies, following Brown and Walnau’s evaluation framework.

Section~\ref{sec:implementation} describes how the prototype was implemented and provides instructions for running the application or extending its functionality.
